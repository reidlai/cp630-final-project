1. what you have done, 

In the period of advancement of technology and financial development, there has been a drastic increase in such activities as credit card payments, banking, online fund transactions and others as a result of the expansion of information technology. While this increase in financial activities has made capital and resource deployment to be more effective, it has also exactly led to the increase of fraudulent activities. Because of the arising complexity of the fraudulent transaction, its defenders fall behind the old solutions and seek for advanced means for counterfeiting and fraud deterrence.

Option Consommateurs (2024) published a report which showed that around 30% of the Canadians remember themselves being a victim of the bank fraud. In fact, among those who felt the effects of bank fraud, almost 25% have taken some measure to defend themselves after the incident. This indicates that the aftermath of such kinds of fraud is not only loss of money but also loss of peace of mind, and victims become more vigilant on the security of their assets.

Fraud is a common phenomenon in the financial arena. Credit card fraud, banker cheque fraud, and EFT fraud and all of them pose great risk to the financial institution and its clients. This misuse of information or financial assets is caused by scam or dishonest persons with serious consequences to economies and the security of consumers. As a result, the issue of fraud transactions which has become common in financial transactions needs to be cured fairly very quickly by all concerned parties in this case the financial institutions.

The classical approaches which have been adopted by many of the companies whereby the review of transactions are being done on manual basis and most times more rules limits systems, is becoming more obsolete not because such systems are not in existence but because the fraud depots have become more advanced in their tactics. The procedures are very time consuming and require a lot of manpower and barely keeps pace with the development of the changes of the type of fraud. Therefore, new technologies for detection and measures to prevent fraud are needed which will be able to provide performance and flexibility in the timely and seamless detection of unauthorized activities.

Over the past few years, ‘machine learning’ techniques have developed as one of the recent technologies for solving problems related to fraud detection in financial transactions. Before applying any model, it is understood that using machine learning requires a large volume of data which comprises past activities connected with fraud and instigates models to recognize them efficiently. Such models can also be designed using historical data on transactions and will keep getting better as additional data will continue becoming available.

In response to this pressing issue, various machine learning techniques have been proposed for fraud detection. One such technique involves the use of LightGBM for Credit Card Fraud Detection (Huang, 2020). This innovative approach to fraud detection could potentially be applied to our project, offering a promising solution to this pervasive problem with supporting  research by Du et al. (2023).

The primary objective of this project lies in identifying the suitable Proof of Concept within the appropriate context and testing the model based approach in the financial market using machine learning methods. The solution will include the use of the Kaggle Dataset ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions as it is based on the publication of Altman, E (2019). A number of elements may be identified as being part of this issue and the answer.

1. **Dataset Acquisition**: For the purpose of obtaining the dataset from Kaggle It is necessary to design a web UI as the AI Engineers will find it more convenient to fetch the required dataset from the UI I built. 
2. **Data Review and Mapping**: Up to this point, the dataset is in the AI Engineer’s hands, so the schema of the dataset will be examined by the AI Engineer. An editor will be developed in order to ease this occasion. Such tool will also allow artificial intelligence engineers’ simple data mapping on different dataset file format that are part of the dataset. They can also find pertinent attributes in the data and map them to their functions as well. Eventually, such mapping will support data understanding and also form part of the data to be fed into the ML operations of AI. This self-contained, visual tool will improve the process of reviewing data and also ensure that the AI model uses the important components.
3. **MLOps Pipeline**: To begin the MLOps pipeline using the MLOps platform a Rest API will be developed. At the earlier API calls MLOps data pipeline Rest endpoint of different platform will be invoked and this MLOps pipeline will cover those of data preparation engineering features and phases of AI model training as well as testing.
4. **AI Model Development**: The final step is the implementation of the MLOps pipeline that will incorporate the deployment of the ONNX model derived from the well trained AI model developed at the final stages of the training and testing processes.
5. **Transaction Validation**: To trigger the validation step, a Payment Order User Interface is being developed which will integrate with Payment Processing backend service. This particular service will leverage another machine learning inference background service which loads the AI model for fraud detection. If a transaction is suspected to be fraudulent then the transaction will be put on pending and a risk manager will be notified in order to investigate the transaction further.
6. **Notification of Customer**: Also if the transaction is recognized as a potentially fraudulent one, the customer will be sent an email about the potential fraud and further security check process.
