<h1 class="title">CP630 Project Proposal<br>LightGBM for Credit Card
Fraud Detection</h1>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In the period of advancement of technology and financial development,
there has been a drastic increase in such activities as credit card
payments, banking, online fund transactions and others as a result of
the expansion of information technology. While this increase in
financial activities has made capital and resource deployment to be more
effective, it has also exactly led to the increase of fraudulent
activities. Because of the arising complexity of the fraudulent
transaction, its defenders fall behind the old solutions and seek for
advanced means for counterfeiting and fraud deterrence.</p>
<p>Option Consommateurs (2024) published a report which showed that
around 30% of the Canadians remember themselves being a victim of the
bank fraud. In fact, among those who felt the effects of bank fraud,
almost 25% have taken some measure to defend themselves after the
incident. This indicates that the aftermath of such kinds of fraud is
not only loss of money but also loss of peace of mind, and victims
become more vigilant on the security of their assets.</p>
<h1 id="problem-solving-and-algorithms">Problem Solving and
Algorithms</h1>
<p>Over the past few years, ‘machine learning’ techniques have developed
as one of the recent technologies for solving problems related to fraud
detection in financial transactions. Before applying any model, it is
understood that using machine learning requires a large volume of data
which comprises past activities connected with fraud and instigates
models to recognize them efficiently. Such models can also be designed
using historical data on transactions and will keep getting better as
additional data will continue becoming available.</p>
<p>In response to this pressing issue, various machine learning
techniques have been proposed for fraud detection. One such technique
involves the use of LightGBM for Credit Card Fraud Detection (Huang,
2020). This innovative approach to fraud detection could potentially be
applied to our project, offering a promising solution to this pervasive
problem with supporting research by Du et al. (2023).</p>
<h1 id="proposed-system-design">Proposed System Design</h1>
<p>The system is subdivided into several vital containers as
follows:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Solution Component</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Machine Learning Model</td>
<td>This is the pre-built open source machine learning model download
from external source. This model was built based on LightGBM.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Payment Processing Service</td>
<td>This is public facing service that response for the processing of
payments from merchants who made the Payment request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Payment Request Store</td>
<td>This relational database store gets to store payment requests and
payment request status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Machine Learning Inference Service</td>
<td>This services mainly serve all fraud detection request against
incoming payment request. It will get and use machine learning model to
identify any possible frauds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Payment Notification Service</td>
<td>This is outside system which sends email alerts to the Customer
especially when a Transaction made is on hold for suspected fraudulent
activity.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1 id="proposed-technical-stack">Proposed Technical Stack</h1>
<p>The given technical stack utilizes commonly used or well known
technologies and frameworks thus making it secure and easily adaptable
to changes. The payment solution with fraud detection based on machine
learning relies on the combination of Spring Boot as backend, Svelte as
frontend, Mage.AI for MLOps, PostgreSQL for data storage, Docker for
virtual technology and SVM as algorithm for dynamic fraud detection in
payments.</p>

<td>Frontend UI + API</td>
<td>Spring Boot and Svelte</td>
<td><strong>Spring Boot</strong> is utilized to create REST APIs of
various services such as Payment Processing Service, Model Inference
Service and more. <strong>Svelte</strong> will be utilized on Dataset
Request UI as well as on Payment Order UI.</td>

<td>PostgreSQL</td>
<td><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> is a complete, open source and high
performance database management system. PostgreSQL can be used to
develop the Payment Request Store.</td>

<tr>
<td>Containerization</td>
<td>Docker and Docker Compose</td>
<td><strong>Docker</strong> is a tool that can be used to deploy backend
services, frontend applications and other components by isolating all
the parts in a uniform environment. <strong>Docker Compose</strong> is
useful in the management of multiple containers that have been defined
with the help of Docker and running them so as to orchestrate the
numerous parts of the architecture.</td>

<td>Machine Learning Model</td>
<td>ONNX</td>
<td><strong>ONNX</strong> Is a standard interface to represent ML models
in its most generic form and can be used for the deployment of the
trained SVM model for inference in the Model Inference Service.</td>

<h1 id="project-timeline">Project Timeline</h1>
<p>The timeline takes into consideration the major steps mentioned in
the project proposal such as dataset acquisition, MLOps workflow, AI
model, Transaction and Customer Notification. It similarly takes into
consideration the integration, testing and the deployment phases.</p>
